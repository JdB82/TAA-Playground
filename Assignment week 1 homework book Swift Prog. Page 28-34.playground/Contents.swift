//OPERATIONS ON INTEGERS//
let numberOfPeople: UInt = 40
let volumeAdjustment: Int32 = 1000

//print(10 + 20)
//print(30 - 5)
//print(5 * 6)

//print(10 + 2 * 5) // 20, because 2 * 5 is evaluated first.
//print(30 - 5 - 5) // 20, because 30 - 5 is evaluated first.

//print((10 + 2) * 5) // 60, because ((10 + 2) is now evaluated first.
//print(30 - (5 - 5)) // 30, because (5 - 5) is now evaluated first.


//INTEGER DEVISION//

//print(11 / 3) // Prints 3

//print(11 % 3) // Prints 2
//print(-11 % 3) // Prints -2


//OPERATOR SHORTHAND//

//var x = 10
//x += 10 // Is eqivalent to: x = x + 10
//print("x has had 10 added to it and is now \(x)")
//x -= 5 // Is equivalent to: x = x - 5
//print("x has had 5 subtracted from it and is now \(x)")


//OVERFLOW OPERATORS//

//let y: Int8 = 120
//let z = y &+ 10
//print("129 &+ 10 is \(z)")


//CONVERTING BETWEEN INTEGER TYPES//

//let a:Int16 = 200
//let b:Int8 = 50
//let c = a + Int16(b)


//FLOATING-POINT NUMBERS//

let d1 = 1.1 // Implicitly Double
let d2: Double = 1.1
let f1: Float = 100.3
//
//print(10.0 + 11.4)
//print(11.0 / 3.0)
//
//if d1 == d2 {
//    print("d1 and d2 are the same!")
//    }

//print("d1 + 0.1 is \(d1 + 0.1)")
//if d1 + 0.1 == 1.2 {
//    print("d1 + 0.1 is equal to 1.2")
//}
