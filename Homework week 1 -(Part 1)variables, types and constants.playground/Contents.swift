//WORKSHEET FOR CODING 1 - VARIABLES, TYPES, STRINGS, CALCULATIONS.

//1:
print("Hello World")

//2:
var word: String

//3:
var tekst:String = ("Hello World")
print(tekst)

//4:
let costant =  "I am Ben"

//5: It give no complain. But what your saying that a constant can't be changed.

//6:
let name = "Ben"
var age:Int = 35
print("I am \(name) I am \(age) years old")

//7.
var number: Int = 3

//8. you will get this error : var number: <<error type>>
var number1 = 3

//9. Becose the devolper help a other developer or people thats gonna work on his code.

//10. We give a comment becose of still have track of your work what you have done.

/* this 
 is 
 an
 integer
 */
var number2 = 3
//this is a constant.
let constant = "I am Ben"

//11.

let age1 = 16
let age2 = 30

//print(age1)(age2)

//12:

var result = 1 * 100
print(result)

result = (100 * 5)
print(result)

result = (200 + 25) - 4
print(result)

result = 200 + 25
print(result)

//NUMBERS AND CALCULATIONS//

//1:

var values = 9
var values1 = 4
result = values * values1
print(result)


//2:

(5 * 3)  / 2 * 2


//3:

let a: Double = 3.5
let b: Int = 20
print(a + Double(b))


//6:

var count = 0
count += 2

var decrement = 20
decrement -= 2
